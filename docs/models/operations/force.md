# Force

force overwriting of duplicate playlists. By default, a playlist file uploaded with the same path will overwrite the existing playlist. 
The `force` argument is used to disable overwriting. If the `force` argument is set to 0, a new playlist will be created suffixed with the date and time that the duplicate was uploaded.
